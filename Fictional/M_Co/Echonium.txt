Echonium-235: A little rarer than Echonium-233, Neutron emitter, Used in Nuclear power

Echonium-237: Exercise extreme caution, Very radioactive and unstable, It Has Properties that we do not understand at this time
This material was made after experimentation of Plutonium,
The laboratory disappeared 2 days after it was discovered, No traces of it ever existing, Rumors has it that its still out there somewhere
