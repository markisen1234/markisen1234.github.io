Echonium is a material found while experimenting with a crystal form of U-233

there are many isotopes

Echonium-230: Most common, Stronger than steel

Echonium-233: Another common one, Melts at 20Â°C, Properties unknown

Echonium-235: A little rarer than Echonium-233, Neutron emitter, Used in Nuclear power

Echonium-237: Exercise extreme caution, Very radioactive and unstable,
Has anomalous properties,
This material was made after experimentation of Plutonium,
The laboratory disappeared 2 days after it was discovered, No traces of it ever existing, Rumors has it that its still out there somewhere
