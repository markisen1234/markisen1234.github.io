Name: Echonium
Page: 1 of 1

Echonium is a material found while experimenting with a crystal form of U-233

There are many Isotopes

Echonium-230: Most common, Stronger than steel

Echonium-233: Another common one, Melts at 20Â°C, Properties unknown

Echonium-235: A little rarer than Echonium-233, Neutron emitter, Used in Nuclear power

Echonium-237: Exercise extreme caution, Very radioactive and unstable, It has Properties that we do not understand at this time
This material was made after experimentation of Plutonium,
Facility-#27 disappeared 2 days after Echonium-237 was discovered, No traces of it ever existing, Rumors has it that its still out there somewhere


First discovered by: Dr. John Mann
First discovered in Facility-#13

Dr. John Mann (Dr. J.M)
[Begin]
Dr. J.M: Lets see... Ah right, im supposed to test on Uranium-233.
[Dr. J.M inserts U-233 into a Tray]
[Dr. J.M inserts the Tray into the Research Core]
[Dr. J.M Starts the Particle Beam at 25%]
[2m later]
Dr. J.M: [looks at the Power] Why is it going up so fast?
Dr. J.M: Uhh... I dont think this is good...
Dr. J.M: Oh no...
[Suddenly all the alarms go off]
Dr. J.M: No no no no... This isnt good...
Dr. J.M: [Walks backwards slowly]
Dr. J.M: [Bumps into a Wall]
Dr. J.M: Well...
[Suddenly a loud bang happens]
Dr. J.M: [Blinded] AAH!
[The Power goes out]
Dr. J.M: [Regains sight] What just happened...
[The Power switches back on]
Dr. J.M: [looks at the new Material inside] What is that...
[The Material glows Blue]
Dr. J.M: Wow... I have never seen that...
[Dr. J.M Opens the chamber and carefully grabs the Echonium]
Dr. J.M: I must report this to my Superiors
[Dr. J.M Walks out of the room]
