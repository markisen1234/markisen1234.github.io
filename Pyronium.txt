Name: Pyronium
Page: 1 of 1

Pyronium was made when mixing Cryonium-A with Echonium-235, 
then heating it to 2500°C and blasting it with neutrons
Pyronium is very unstable

There are currently 2 known isotopes

Pyronium-238 Is the most common one, it is permanently at 2000°C
Dont touch it, It is a very hard material, its red and looks like a Crystal
It reacts violently with acid, The strongest reaction is from sulfuric acid

Pyronium-240 Is very rare, and very unstable,
It reacts violently with Water and any Acid, once in contact with Water or Acid
it will make Echonium-235 and Pyromium-238 with a violent chemical explosion

Discovered by: [Classified]
Discovered in: Facility-#14

Required for critical mass:
	Pyronium-238: ~3kg
	Pyronium-240: ~350g

Safety protocols:
	Pyronium-238:
		Do not come near it
		Call M Co.
		Stay 50m away as it radiates heat
		Stay Calm
	Pyronium-240:
		Do not come near it
		Call M Co.
		Run
