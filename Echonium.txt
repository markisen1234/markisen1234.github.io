Page: 1 of 1

Echonium is a material found while experimenting with a crystal form of U-233

There are many Isotopes

Echonium-230: Most common, Stronger than steel

Echonium-233: Another common one, Feels like a very soft fabric, Warm

Echonium-235: A little rarer than Echonium-233, Neutron emitter, Used in Nuclear power

Echonium-237: Exercise extreme caution, Very radioactive and unstable, It has Properties that we do not understand at this time
This material was made after experimentation of Plutonium,
Facility-#27 disappeared 2 days after Echonium-237 was discovered, No traces of it ever existing, Rumors has it that its still out there somewhere

Required mass for criticality:
	Echonium-230: NaN
	Echonium-233: NaN
	Echonium-235: ~75kg
	Echonium-237: ~500g

Safety protocals:
	Echonium-230: None
	Echonium-233: None
	Echonium-235:
		Normally, Echonium-235 is not dangerous, it emits Alpha particles
		Alpha particles cannot pierce skin, just dont eat it, i know its tempting
		In case of reactor meltdown:
			Get a M Co. Standard issue HAZMAT suit
		In case of nuclear explosion:
			Run
	Echonium-237:
		Stay away from it at all costs
		Do not try to come near it
		Get out of the Building
		Stay 150m away from the Building

First discovered by: Dr. John Mann
First discovered in Facility-#13
